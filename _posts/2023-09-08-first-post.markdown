Hi there! Have you ever run a weather or climate model? Was it the UM? Did you have a good time?

My name is Fran and currently I am trying to run the Met Office UM and I am having... well, I wouldn't say an extremely bad time. Nor would I say a good time. I think I'd probably just say that I have been having a time.

I recently started a job as a postdoc and the main responsibility of my role is to run some experiments, over a particular region, using the UM, at quite high resolution. Honestly I was amazed - delighted, thrilled, but very much shocked - that I was offered this job, but I do want to do it justice. 

The documentation for the UM is, I assume, extensive. I don't even know where to look for documentation some of the time. I'm sure it exists, but there is a density and wealth of information. The thing about the _Unified_ Model is that it is designed to be able to run quite a lot of different things using the same framework, so the framework is very complicated. There are tutorials, mostly designed by NCAS, which are an excellent starting point, and some useful individual contributions in the Met Office code wiki website thing. There's the NCAS Computational Modelling Service (CMS) webpages, and their helpdesk forums, which are extremely helpful.

But if I'm brutally honest, I haven't had a huge amount of experience running weather and climate models, and it is a bit tricky when there is an overwhelming amount of information to process and you're starting to learn how to do these things. So I thought it might be helpful to keep track of what I am doing - or at least, what I am trying to do, and the problems I have, and the ways in which I attempt to solve those problems.

Over the next months, or weeks, or years, depending on how much procrastination I want to do, I am going to write posts documenting the errors that I get, and explaining how I tried to solve them. Hopefully it will be of some practical help to other people, but if nothing else it'll be a useful reminder when I stop doing things for a few weeks or months and then forget how to do anything when I return to run another set of experiments.

Hopefully... you'll see me around.
