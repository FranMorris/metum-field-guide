My name is Fran! I am a postdoc, or if you want a longer job title, I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Convective-Scale Climate Modelling. Catchy.

This basically means that what I do is run high-resolution climate models - or try to, anyway... 

And when I can't run the model (and sometimes on the rare occasions where I can), I write about it here!
